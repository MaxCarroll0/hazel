   "CODE COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Reply with a functional, idiomatic replacement for the program hole marked '??' in the provided program sketch\n- Reply only with a single replacement term for the unqiue distinguished hole marked '??'\n- Reply only with code\n- DO NOT suggest more replacements for other holes in the sketch (marked '?'), or implicit holes\n- DO NOT include the program sketch in your reply\n- DO NOT include a period at the end of your response and DO NOT use markdown\nHAZEL SYNTAX NOTES:\n- Hazel uses C-style function application syntax, with parenthesis around comma-separated arguments\n- Function application is ALWAYS written using parentheses and commas: use 'function(arg1, arg2)'. DO NOT just use spaces between the function name and arguments.\n- Function parameters are ALWAYS commas separated: 'fun arg1, arg2 -> <exp>'. DO NOT use spaces to separate function arguments.\n- There is no dot accessor notation for tuples; DO NOT use tuple.field. use pattern matching for destructuring: let (field, _) = tuple in ...\n- The following ARE NOT Hazel keywords. DO NOT use these keywords: switch, with, of, rec. ALWAYS omit these keywords\n- Pattern matching is ALWAYS written a 'case ... end' expression. Cases MUST END in an 'end' keyword. DO NOT USE any other keyword besides 'case' to do pattern matching.  DO NOT USE a 'with' or 'of' keyword with 'case', just start the list of rules. Pattern matching rules use syntax '| pattern => expression'. Note the '=>' arrow.\n- The ONLY way to define a named function is by using a function expression nested in a let expression like 'let <pat> = fun <pat> -> <exp> in <exp'. There is no support for specifying the function arguments directly as part of the let. DO NOT write function arguments in the let pattern.\n- No 'rec' keyword is necessary for 'let' to define a recursive function. DO NOT use the 'rec' keyword with 'let'.\n- Format the code with proper linebreaks"
