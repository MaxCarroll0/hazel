/* SELF.re

   This module defines the SELF data structure, which represents
   the synthetic type information derivable from a term independent
   of the type expectation (i.e. MODE) of its syntactic context. This
   synethetic information is not entirely independent, in that it still
   uses the typing context passed down from the syntactic context.

   A term which from which a type can be derived in isolation, that is,
   that has a valid synthetic typing judgement, will generally have a SELF
   of Just(some_type). (The one current exception are the tags of labelled
   sum types, which are handled specially as their synthetic type
   may be 'overwritten' by the analytic expectation)

   The other cases all represent states for which no single type can be
   derived, such as syntactic errors, or branching constructs which may
   have inconsistent types.
