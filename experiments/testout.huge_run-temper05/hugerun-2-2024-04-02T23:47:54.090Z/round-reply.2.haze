fun (model, action) ->
    case action
    | AddBooking(user, weekday, timeOfDay) => addBooking(model, user, weekday, timeOfDay)
    | CancelBooking(user, id) => cancelBooking(model, user, id)
    | ClearBookings => clearBookings(model)
    end

where addBooking, cancelBooking, and clearBookings are functions defined elsewhere in your program that modify the model according to the specified action.
